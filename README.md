# GENAI-improvU
Functional AI chat prototype (JAZZ feature) for the Vibe Coding project.

Phase 1 - Landing page
This was created with cursor and is hosted with Vercel. I am new to web/app development, so I don't know how to integrate JAZZ into my landing page yet.

Github repo: https://github.com/comaverick18/DPS-improv

Vercel Site: https://dps-improv.vercel.app/
I worked hard on this and think it's pretty good. 

JAZZ - Phase 2 Prototype (This Repo)
This repository contains the functional prototype for improvU, a web app designed to help users build conversational confidence. This prototype was built for the Vibe Coding: Phase 2 project.

This prototype demonstrates the "JAZZ" feature, a one-on-one "Guided Lesson Chat" with an AI-powered improv coach.

Instructions to View
Download the index.html file.

Open the file in any modern web browser.

You will need to add your own Google Gemini API key to the index.html file's code to run the chat.

AI Component Specification
This project meets the assignment's AI requirement by providing a Functional Integration of the Google Gemini API.

* What the AI Does: The AI's task is to perform text generation. It acts as a conversational chatbot named "JAZZ," an encouraging and playful improv coach. Its behavior is controlled by a detailed system prompt inside the JavaScript code.

* Why It Was Chosen: Instead of a simple "demo" with pre-written text, a functional AI integration was chosen to demonstrate the product's core value. The AI provides a real, adaptive, and interactive lesson. It can answer user questions and adapt its explanations, which a static prototype could not do.

* How It Improves the Product: This AI component is the core of the improvU experience. It directly supports the product's main goal by giving users a safe, judgment-free, and truly interactive space to learn the foundational "Yes, and..." skill, which is the first step to building conversational confidence.
